## 🧪 Practical Tasks

### ✅ **Task 1 – Toggle a CSS Class**
**Objective:** Create a button that toggles a class on an element.
**Example:** Toggle `highlight` class on a paragraph to change its background color.
```javascript
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  document.getElementById("para").classList.toggle("highlight");
});
```

### ✅ **Task 2 – Loop Through Student List and Show in Table**
**Objective:** Use a loop to display a list of students with name and grade in an HTML table.
**Example:**
```javascript
const students = [
  { name: "Ali", grade: 90 },
  { name: "Sara", grade: 85 },
  { name: "Omar", grade: 78 }
];

students.forEach(student => {
  console.log(`${student.name} got ${student.grade}`);
});
```
You can insert these into a table dynamically.

  { name: "Sara Mostafa", email: "sara@example.com" },
